End of the 'put()' test for hash table in quadratic probing mechanism¡£
========================================Step 6: Dynamic Resizing.========================================
1.Begin of the 'put()' test for hash table in linear probing mechanism with a dynamic capacity.
The total run time to put 10000 pairs into the table is: 284 ms
------------------------------------------------------
2.Get all pairs from the table:
The total run time to get all pairs from the table is: 553 ms
